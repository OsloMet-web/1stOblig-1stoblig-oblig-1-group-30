            The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) are two distinct concepts. 
            The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other
            using standardized communication protocols.
            It is a vast infrastructure that enables the exchange of information and 
            data between computers across the world.

            The World Wide Web, on the other hand, is a collection of web pages and multimedia content that are 
            accessed over the Internet using web browsers. It is a subset of the Internet that allows users 
            to access and share information in the form of text, images, videos, and other multimedia content. 
            In essence, the World Wide Web is a service that runs on top of the Internet infrastructure.
