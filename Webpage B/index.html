			Hristo - I decided to skip the part with writing some info about my
			previous school. It is just a bunch of text that we must put here so
			instead of writing about boring stuff why not have some fun or just
			relax. Haha, I am just kidding folks :). School is important
			business:) I come from Bulgaria and have a bachelor degree in
			economics from there. Now I have started at OsloMet as a student
			because I think acquiring new skills is always useful and combining
			economics with information technology can give me a fresh new
			perspective on dealing with all kind of practical issues in everyday
			life as well as on the job.

			Njaal - I'm an exchange student at OsloMet, but I'm originally from
			Norway. I usually study at the University of Applied Sciences of the
			Grisons in Switzerland. Having lived in Switzerland since I was 3
			years old, I'm fluent in both German and Norwegian. What I miss from
			my school in Switzerland are the beautiful mountains that surround
			my university :)

			Joseph - I am an exchange student from the United States and I go to
			the University of Iowa! a 'fun' fact about UIowa is that it is
			ranked as one of the top party schools in the US :P
