The purpose of this repository is to create the first obligatory assignment for the class Data 1200. 
We should create webpage A with some text and at least two headings. 
We should create a second page B as well. In page B every student in the group enters their own student number 
as a heading and a few lines about their old school in a paragraph.
In the log "Commits" on GitHub every student in the group should participate as collaborator.
In each page we must include a link from Page A to Page B, and vice versa.
We should submit GitHub link as our assignment hand-in. 
Deadline is 7 September 23:59.
